                <h1>Create your own plugin</h1>
                <p>
                    As you can see under <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/plugin-registry/editors">Editor's Pick</a>, Highcharts can be extended in a number of ways. The best plugins are flexible and reusable, and you can make your own by following <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/docs/extending-highcharts">Extending Highcharts</a>.
                </p>
                <h2>Publish your plugin</h2>
                <h3>Create repository on GitHub</h3>
                <p>
                    This repository will contain all materials that is crucial or you find necessary that people should have. If you are new on GitHub, or have forgotten some of the basics, please have a look at their manual for <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo">Create a Repo</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>Add a Webhook</h3>
                <p>
                    The link to receive the post is: <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/plugin-registry/hook">http://www.highcharts.com/plugin-registry/hook</a>. To add webhooks to a GitHub repository, follow their manual on <a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/">Creating Webhooks</a>.

                    <strong>Important</strong>, set Content Type to: <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>.
                </p>
                <h3>Add a manifest to the repository</h3>
                <p>
                    Create a new file named manifest.json. Make sure the file ending is .json and not .txt. The file must contain som required information and maybe some of the optional fields is relevant. It is crucial that this file contains valid json syntax. To check this you can use <a href="http://jsonlint.com/">JSONLint</a>. In the table you can information of all the possible attributes and a short description of their use. Some of these are marked as required, without these attributes the registry process will discard your plugin.
                </p>

                <h3>And finally the publishing</h3>
                <p>
                    When all the necessities above are done, just make a push on your repository. If the registering of your plugin is a first, make sure that the name is not taken, else the plugin will not be registered and you will be notified by email. When updating a plugin you have to make sure that the version is newer then the already registered plugin. The publishing should not take long and you should get notified by email. If nothing has happened and there is no notifications in your inbox, please check that your manifest file is valid json.
